3.1: I learned that when leading a group of people, it's good to foster an environment of thinkers rather than just followers.
4.1: I'm really proud of being able to use flex properties in CSS. Up until now, I never really got the gist of it and stuck to the grid system instead. Today, I was able to get a good understanding of flex through some online research.
5.1: I feel like my website designs really made the experience more user-friendly. Rather than the generic hardcore health and gym aesthetics that fitness websites tend to use, I used images with more relaxed colors.
