# Hi this is Leo!

> Today I worked on setting up the structure of the project and some of the pages. Unfortunately I didn't get the browser-sync working but that's an issue for another day
> My role is the database specialist as well as the front end dev which I'm tackling with Zero
> Tomorrow I hope to get my browser sync working so I can start designing the pages as well as working with Andrew to ensure that they are functional
> My biggest challenge today was having to wait for people to push before I made changes in their file. I wanted to avoid merge conflicts but I also wanted to edit their files to fix things

> A new challenge that arose today was CSS. It is very time consuming. Another one was resolving merge conflicts.
> 1 resource I am using to learn/research is the Super Squad project and Stack Overflow.
> 1 resource I'm using to collaborate with my teammates is Canva.
