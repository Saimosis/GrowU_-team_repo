hello from Andrew

Journal Entry #1 10-1-24

We accomplished a good amount, set up the basic framework for the code, made the routes, and started on designing

My role is the backend developer and I have to deal with the express kind of code, setting up the routes and moving around data and doing checks

I hope to get the data moving code set up

My biggest challenge was fixing my branch on git
