hello from Andrew

Journal Entry #1 10-1-24

We accomplished a good amount, set up the basic framework for the code, made the routes, and started on designing

My role is the backend developer and I have to deal with the express kind of code, setting up the routes and moving around data and doing checks

I hope to get the data moving code set up

My biggest challenge was fixing my branch on git 

Journal Entry #2 10-2-24

One new challenge that arose is trying to alert the user of an already existing user, and that they need to create a different user

One resource I am utilizing is chrome, I don't have a specific website, I am just doing a quick google search and using that as a reference

We are using canva to help think together on the vision we have for the UI and how sleek and smooth we can make it
